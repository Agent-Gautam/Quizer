❖ Libraries used
  • Colorama

  on all platforms, using the same ANSI codes as described in many
  other answers on this page.
  • Pyfiglet
  The Pyfiglet module is a Python module that comes with many
  functions, and we can use these functions in a Python program to
  create fancy texts with large fonts & sizes in the output. The
  Pyfiglet module is specially designed to enhance our programming
  experience as well as to enhance the overall look and structure of
  the texts used in electronic communication .
  • OS
  This library is used to take control over the operating system like
  creating, modifying and deleting file . It is used in the program to
  make dummy files which need not be saved in user’s computer
  and are used only in while the program is running. 
  • Time
  Time library of python is used for time related activities in the
  program like taking real time from computer , printing time, and
  also to slow program execution . It is used in the code to make
  some visual effects to user which looks soothing improving user
  Experience.
❖ Uses and working
  • Making a quiz
  A user can make its own quiz while using this cmd run application.
  Quiz is made by asking one question and four corresponding
  options along with one correct option . All these are stored in a list
  for further processing.
  • Making file out of quiz
  A user can make a text file of quiz made by him all in cmd run
  quizet application. File of quiz consists of questions in serial order
  followed by corresponding options . All the correct answers are
  mentioned at the end of text file.
  • Playing quiz
  A user can choose to either make file then play quiz or play
  without making file or play from existing file . When user choose
  to do both saved questions and options are shown to user and one
  option is asked if it matches the correct option user is shown with
  text ‘correct answer’ . If user only chooses to play quiz and not to
  make file then a ‘dummy’ file is created where all the content of
  quiz is stored and then run . 
❖ Scope and limitations
  • GUI
  Quizer is command prompt window based application and clearly
  lacks a graphical user interface which otherwise would add more
  features and good user experience to the program.
  • Versatility
  This application lacks versatility or customisability as it makes file
  out of the program and file can’t have anything extra other than
  quy, options and answers otherwise it won’t be run .
